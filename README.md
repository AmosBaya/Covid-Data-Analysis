# 📊 COVID-19 Data Analysis with Pandas and Matplotlib

## 📝 Project Overview

This project involves loading, analyzing, and visualizing COVID-19 data using Python libraries — primarily **Pandas** for data manipulation and **Matplotlib/Seaborn** for visualizations.

We explore a real-world dataset from [Our World in Data](https://ourworldindata.org/coronavirus) containing global COVID-19 statistics (e.g., cases, deaths, vaccinations), and draw insights through both descriptive statistics and visualizations.

---

## 🎯 Objectives

- Load and explore a real-world dataset (`.csv`) using Pandas.
- Clean and process the data (handle missing values, filter specific countries, etc.).
- Perform statistical analysis (mean, median, group by).
- Create and customize visualizations:
  - Line plot (trends over time)
  - Bar chart (comparisons)
  - Histogram (distribution)
  - Scatter plot (correlation)

## 📌 How to Run

1. Open [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/).
2. Upload `owid-covid-data.csv` and the `.ipynb` notebook.
3. Run the notebook cell by cell.
4. Follow the code and outputs to explore the dataset interactively.

## 📈 Visualizations

The notebook includes:

- **Line Chart** – COVID-19 cases over time in Kenya.
- **Bar Chart** – Average daily new cases per continent.
- **Histogram** – Distribution of daily deaths.
- **Scatter Plot** – Total cases vs. total deaths (per country).

---

## 🔍 Key Insights

- The number of new COVID-19 cases shows clear waves and peaks.
- There's a strong correlation between total cases and total deaths.
- Certain countries handled the pandemic better based on their statistics.
- Vaccination rates varied widely by region.
